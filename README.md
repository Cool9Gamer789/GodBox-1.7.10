# GodBox Item

A Minecraft mod item that allows players to instantly duplicate and maximize stacks of items in their inventory.

## Features

- **Item Duplication**: Right-click to duplicate the first item in your hotbar
- **Stack Maximization**: All duplicated items are automatically set to their maximum stack size
- **Inventory Filling**: Fills all empty slots in your inventory with the duplicated item
- **Single Use**: Limited to 1 item per stack to prevent abuse

## How to Use

### Finding the GodBox
1. Open your inventory in Creative Mode
2. Navigate to the **Tools** tab
3. Look for the GodBox item (uses the "motherbox" texture)

### Using the GodBox
1. Place any item you want to duplicate in the **first slot** of your hotbar (leftmost slot)
2. Hold the GodBox in your hand
3. **Right-click** while holding the GodBox
4. All empty slots in your inventory will be filled with the maximum stack size of your selected item

## Important Notes
- Only works with the **first hotbar slot** (slot 0)
- The first hotbar slot must contain an item (cannot be empty)
- The first hotbar slot cannot contain the GodBox itself
- Only fills **empty slots** - will not modify existing stacks
- Works in both main inventory and hotbar slots (not the armor slots)
- Server-side processing ensures multiplayer compatibility

## Example
1. Place 1 Diamond in your first hotbar slot
2. Right-click with the GodBox
3. All empty inventory slots will now contain 64 Diamonds (max stack size)
